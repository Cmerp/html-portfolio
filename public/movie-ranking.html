<h2>My top Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Thirteenth Warrior</h3>
<p>Captures the spirit of adventure and aproaches an old tale well.</p>

<h3>Pig</h3>
<p>
  The hight of the Cageaissance, Pig delivers and emotional experience I was not
  prepared for.
</p>

<h3>No Country for Old Men</h3>
<p>
  The Coen brothers offer something very uniqe here as far as story direction
  and Javier Bardem gives the performance of a lifetime.
